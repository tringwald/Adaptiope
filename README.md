## Modern Office-31

Our proposed **Modern Office-31** dataset with our refurbished Amazon domain and an additional synthetic domain.
Note that this download also contains the original Office-31 DSLR domain for a total of 7.210 images. The setup in our paper only used the Amazon, Synthetic and Webcam domains with a total of 6.712 files. However, the additional domain can be used to reproduce our **Refurbished Office-31** experiments with domains Amazon, DSLR and Webcam.
